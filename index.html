					<h2>Hi There!</h2>

							I hope the summer months are treating you well. These are exciting times ahead for the CIS, and we are looking forward to welcoming you to our community.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the new academic year starting August 2023, the Core Curriculum theme of the freshman course, Big Questions, will be Happiness and Suffering and we have already secured an esteemed set of speakers including Carolyn Chen (of UC Berkeley), Jeffrey Sachs (of Columbia) and Linda Barclay (of Monash) who will share their insights on topics such as work, religion, poverty, justice and equality through the academic year. Our student leaders are contributing to the programming too. Our student society, inCISive, will be hosting a 2-week long event called the Integrative Fiesta in September that will feature an exciting line-up of site visits and panel discussions that span topics such as sustainable businesses, law and technology, and urban planning and management. You’ll see that there is no lack of enriching and meaningful events at the CIS.
						</p>
						<p>
							In other news, the College has, in the last two weeks, inked exclusive student exchange agreements between CIS and the University College London’s Bachelor of Arts and Science programme, York University’s Faculty of Environment and Urban Change and York’s School of the Arts, Media, Performance & Design. The College leadership is also in discussion with the NYU Gallatin School of Individualised Study for student exchange and faculty collaboration opportunities. Indeed, we are excited to host an NYU delegation by the Gallatin Dean, Victoria Rosner. who will be visiting SMU early 2024.
						</p>
						<p>
							On a more personal note, our faculty and I have also planned for intimate networking sessions among ourselves so that we can get to know each other better, and of course to network, via a series of Dean’s Teas as well as fireside chats and exclusive coffee sessions with our CIS Board members and other CEOs. We look forward to getting to know you better in the coming months. Till then, have a wonderful rest of the break and I look forward to welcoming you to the CIS very soon.
