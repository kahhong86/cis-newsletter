						<h2>HI THERE!</h2>

						<p>

							We are thrilled that you have accepted the offer to join the SMU College of Integrative Studies, and we warmly welcome you to our close-knit community. 

						</p>

						<p>

							I hope the summer months are treating you well. My colleagues and I are eagerly anticipating your arrival on campus.  

						</p>

						<p>

							In the new academic year starting August 2024, the theme of Big Questions, the flagship freshmen core curriculum course, will be Happiness and Suffering. You can anticipate a lineup of esteemed speakers who will share with you what their  real-life interpretations of this theme, a field trip to an NHB-managed site, and possibly some of the most committed teachers you will ever encounter.

						</p>

						<p>

							As our second matriculating class, you will  be right in the midst of our growing phase. I am delighted to share that we have recently established the Wee Kim Wee Scholarship. This scholarship will support bright CIS freshmen in your pursuit of learning for impact. We have also recently awarded two of your seniors the BIS Merit Scholarship in recognition of the quality of their Individualised Major proposals and their excellent service to the CIS student community. In addition, we will soon award the next tranche of the Steve Tay Vision Grant, a special fund recently set up specifically to support CIS students’ passion pursuits beyond the classroom, because we are committed to building a College without borders. 

						</p>

						<p>

							In other news, the College is finalising a partnership agreement with New York University’s Gallatin School of Individualised Study, the oldest extant School of its (our shared individualised) genre, which will make CIS the Gallatin School’s only student exchange partner globally. The partnership will include opportunities for students to participate in co-taught classes, some of which may be conducted in NYU or one of NYU’s global satellite campuses. This adds to our ever-growing list of exclusive partners (for which dedicated spots are reserved specifically for CIS students), which includes University College London, University of Toronto, York University (UK), York University (Canada), and National Chengchi University, amongst others. Indeed, two of your seniors will be heading to UCL in September as part of an agreement between CIS and the UCL BASc programme, our cousins in individualised learning in the UK. This June-July period, some of our students will be attending programmes at Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, Yonsei in Korea and the Berklee College of Music in the US. So you see that we have a network of co-conspirators in the future of higher education where the border of disciplines and cultures are porous, even obliterated. 

						</p>

					<p>

						Our faculty are also busy this coming summer. Fiona Williamson (Associate Professor of Environmental History; Associate Dean (Undergraduate Education)), Terry Van Gevelt (Associate Professor of Urban Sustainability) and Winston Chow (Professor of Urban Climate & Co-Chair, Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) are deep in preparations on an innovative undergraduate Climate Change course where segments of the course would be delivered through video content produced together with CNA. We also have colleagues working on religious wisdom in film, AI and law-enforcement, water security in the Western US, presenting their academic discoveries in the interregnum between semesters where faculty put on their other professional hat, creating new knowledge. 

					</p>

					<p>

						As you prepare yourselves for an amazing journey, I thought also to share that CIS students who apply will receive prioritised admissions into the Prinsep Street Residences (PSR). This is a wonderful way to embed yourself to our vibrant community. Read on to hear more about PSR from Assistant Professor Giovanni Ko, our Lead Faculty Fellow, and a few of our CIS students.

					</p>

					<p>

						Last but not least, to give you a sense of the semester ahead--we have curated a litany of social events to complement your time in the classroom. There will be a series of Dean’s Teas, as well as workshops and exclusive coffee sessions with our CIS Board members and other C-suite industry leaders in the coming months. Our very active student society, inCISive, has also planned several activities that will put the icing on the collegiate experience cake that CIS is all about. So, I speak for the faculty when I say that we can barely wait to welcome you in August. Till then, have a wonderful rest of the summer months and I look forward to meeting and getting to know each and every one of you soon.
